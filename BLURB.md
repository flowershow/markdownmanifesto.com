One idea for a title and tagline:

Markdown
Own your content
So you can use the best (all) the tools for the job

I'm trying to get at the point here that you own all your content and you can then connect it with anything else you want! Like you can connect it with a Claude code or whatever. You can plug it in with whatever you want.

Those two points, owning your content and having control of your content, I guess it's actually more than owning. I control my content, and that allows me to use the best tool for the job. I'm not quite getting as sexy as I would like, but that's the idea. 

## Ideas

### A

Markdown
Your content. Any tool

## Option B

Markdown
Own the source.
Compose with anything.
