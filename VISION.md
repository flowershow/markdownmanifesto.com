# Vision

I want to create a Markdown manifesto. I have probably written parts of this before, but let’s start again from first principles.

The core vision is that Markdown is going to eat the world, in a way analogous to how code is eating the world. Markdown is a format you can use for almost everything. Not literally everything, but a very large proportion of the content we currently lock into proprietary or heavyweight systems.

Markdown is a simple, interoperable base, analogous to the Unix philosophy of pipes: small components that work everywhere and compose well. It works with Git, with any text editor, across platforms, and across tools. It is increasingly the lingua franca of digital text: supported by Google Docs, WhatsApp, Discord, GitHub, and many others.

With AI, this becomes even more important. AI needs something more structured than raw text, but lighter and more interoperable than proprietary document formats. Markdown is extremely token-efficient, structured, copy-pasteable, and easy for both humans and machines to work with. It is almost the ideal interchange format for human–AI collaboration.

Markdown is plain text with superpowers. It keeps all the benefits of plain text—longevity, portability, readability, version control—while adding structure. Headings, lists, checklists, tables, code blocks, and metadata give it expressive power without sacrificing simplicity.

Crucially, Markdown is extensible. Through fenced blocks and conventions, you can embed code, data, diagrams, and even HTML when needed. You can start simple and progressively add richness. While it is not designed for highly complex layout, for a large class of documents and applications this is a feature, not a bug.

Because Markdown combines structured metadata with unstructured text, it can function as the basis for databases, content systems, websites, and knowledge bases. Much of what people do in systems like Notion can be done in Markdown with modest conventions and tooling.

The manifesto claim is that we should build far more Markdown-native applications: Markdown databases, Markdown websites, Markdown knowledge systems, Markdown-first workflows. Markdown is human-readable, machine-readable, extensible, and effectively eternal. It will still be usable when today’s platforms are gone.

## 2. Core claims / points of the manifesto

### Foundational claim

* Plain text is the most durable digital medium; Markdown is plain text evolved.

### Interoperability

* Markdown works everywhere, across tools, platforms, and workflows.
* It aligns with Unix-style composability rather than platform lock-in.

### Human–machine bridge

* Markdown is readable by humans and structured enough for machines.
* It is unusually well-suited to AI interaction due to structure and token efficiency.

### Expressive minimalism

* Markdown provides just enough structure to be powerful without becoming brittle or over-engineered.
* Constraints are a feature: they keep focus on meaning rather than presentation.

### Extensibility

* Through conventions and fenced blocks, Markdown can grow without breaking.
* Richness can be layered on incrementally.

### Longevity and sovereignty

* Markdown content remains usable independent of vendors, platforms, or software lifecycles.
* It supports version control, diffing, and long-term archival.

### Application horizon

* Databases, knowledge bases, documentation, websites, and “content systems” can be Markdown-native.
* Many existing tools could be re-imagined as Markdown-first rather than GUI-first.

## 3. Narrative arc for a one-page manifesto

1. Opening declaration

   * “In the beginning was plain text.”

2. Diagnosis

   * The world is drowning in proprietary formats and locked-in systems.

3. Revelation

   * Markdown has quietly become the lingua franca of digital knowledge.

4. Acceleration

   * AI makes Markdown not just convenient but strategically essential.

5. Principle

   * Plain text with structure beats complex systems with brittle schemas.

6. Provocation

   * Most content tools should be rebuilt Markdown-first.

7. Call to action

   * Write in Markdown. Store in Markdown. Build on Markdown.

If you want, next we can:

* Draft a sharp, aphoristic one-page manifesto.
* Produce a shorter “placard version” (10–12 lines).
* Develop a longer essay version that expands each claim.
